Rustdown
========

Rustdown is a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) processor written in Rust. It's still fairly work-in-progress right now. The goal is for it to take input Markdown files and emit HTML documents.

Perhaps a longer-term goal is for it to be usable as a library, and be extensible enough that others may add features to it without too much work.
